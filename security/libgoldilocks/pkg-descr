libgoldilocks library is a production library, providing the ed448
elliptic curve. It is based on Mike Hamburg's libdecaf library:
ed448goldilocks.

This library is intended for developers who have experience with
cryptography. It doesn't (yet?) include documentation on how to use
digital signatures or key exchange securely. Consult your local
cryptographer for advice.

libgoldilocks is currently used by otrv4.
