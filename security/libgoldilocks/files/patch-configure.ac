This is required to enable builds in architectures other than amd64
(x86_64). Currently supports i386/armv6/armv7/aarch64.

The upstream as of now "hardcodes" amd64 (x86_64) as the only build
option.

Now it does a host CPU check and picks the architecture accordingly.

XXX: What is the usecase of arch_neon?
